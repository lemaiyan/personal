## 🔍 **Possible Sources of 95.6K Deficit**

### Most Likely Explanations:

1. **Personal Money Used**: You may have used personal funds to cover project expenses
2. **Multiple Bank Accounts**: Expenses paid from accounts not tracked in the 293K balance
3. **Cash Payments**: Large cash payments made but not properly reflected in bank balance
4. **M-Pesa from Different Numbers**: Payments from family/friends' M-Pesa accounts
5. **Credit/Loans**: Temporary funding from loans or credit that need repayment

### Questions to Verify:

- ✅ Are all 216 transactions legitimate? (Categories and amounts look reasonable)
- ❓ Were any expenses paid from other bank accounts?
- ❓ Did you use personal savings for the project?
- ❓ Are there any large cash withdrawals not accounted for?
- ❓ Did family members contribute funds directly to suppliers?

## 🎯 **Recommendations**

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Reconcile Bank Statements**: Check all accounts used for project payments
2. **Track Cash Flows**: Account for any cash payments or personal money used
3. **Identify All Funding Sources**: List every source of money used for the project
4. **Plan for 180K Gap**: Secure funding for remaining obligations + deficit

### Next Steps:

1. Complete outstanding contractor payments (54.4K)
2. Pay accumulated labor wages (30.2K)
3. Source additional 95.6K to balance the books
4. Set up proper project account separation going forward

## ⚠️ **Critical Finding**

The expenses themselves appear legitimate and well-documented. The deficit likely stems from using multiple funding sources (personal money, family contributions, other accounts) without proper tracking in a single project account.
